# Code Complexity Estimator for Smart Contracts
Author: Oskar Triebe

## Purpose
This is a scoring tool to estimate the complexity of a project based on its source code.
It is designed for smart contracts based on Solidity. However, it could easily be repurposed for Python or other languages.

## Use
High-level overview:
Given a path to a the source code filesystem, the scoring tool computes a complexity score in the range of [0, 1].
